1. Creating a Python Package
Choose a package name and create a directory structure for your package.
Write your Python code within the package's modules.
Include an __init__.py file in the package directory.
Add package metadata in a setup.py file.
Optionally, install development tools (setuptools, wheel) for package development.
Build and install your package locally using python setup.py develop.
Distribute your package using python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel.
Optionally, upload your package to PyPI using twine.
Others can install your package from PyPI using pip install package-name.
2. Creating a Command Interpreter with the cmd Module
Import the cmd module.
Create a custom subclass of cmd.Cmd.
Define command methods starting with "do_".
Customize the command prompt and behavior as needed.
Execute the interpreter with MyCmdInterpreter().cmdloop().
3. Unit Testing in a Large Project
Choose a testing framework (e.g., unittest, pytest).
Organize your code into modular components.
Write test cases for each unit.
Automate testing and integrate it into your development workflow.
Isolate dependencies (e.g., using mocking).
Organize test suites for grouping related tests.
Continuously execute and monitor tests.
Document tests and maintain them as the project evolves.
4. Serializing and Deserializing a Class
Use the pickle module for serialization and deserialization.
Serialize a class instance with pickle.dump(obj, file).
Deserialize a class instance with obj = pickle.load(file).
5. Writing and Reading JSON Files
Use the json module to work with JSON data.
Write JSON data to a file with json.dump(data, file).
Read JSON data from a file with loaded_data = json.load(file).
6. Managing Datetime
Import the datetime module.
Get the current date and time with datetime.now().
Create specific date and time objects using date() and time().
Format datetime objects using strftime().
Parse datetime strings into datetime objects using strptime().
Perform datetime arithmetic with timedelta.
Work with time zones using third-party libraries like pytz.
7. UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
UUID is a 128-bit identifier for unique identification.
UUIDs are globally unique, unpredictable, and persistent.
Use the uuid module to work with UUIDs.
Common versions include time-based (version 1), random (version 4), and namespace-based (version 5) UUIDs.
8. *args - Handling Variable-Length Positional Arguments
Use *args to collect variable-length positional arguments in a function.
Arguments passed using *args are collected into a tuple.
The parameter name args is conventional but can be any valid name.
Useful for functions that accept a varying number of arguments.
9. **kwargs - Handling Variable-Length Keyword Arguments
Use **kwargs to collect variable-length keyword arguments in a function.
Arguments passed using **kwargs are collected into a dictionary.
The parameter name kwargs is conventional but can be any valid name.
Useful for creating flexible functions with varying named parameters.
10. Handling Named Arguments in a Function
Pass values to a function by specifying parameter names in the function call.
Named arguments make code more readable and prevent errors in argument order.
Named arguments are optional, and functions can have default values.
Mix named and positional arguments as needed.
